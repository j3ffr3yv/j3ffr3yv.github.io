                <h3>Software Engineer</h3>
                <p> My earliest encounters with computers sparked a curiosity that has evolved into an unquenchable
                    passion for technology. Witnessing the transformative power of software solutions, I was captivated
                    by the idea of creating tools that enhance lives, simplify processes, and push the boundaries of innovation.

            <dl>
                <dt>Leadership and Team Management:</dt> 
                    <dd> As a retail store manager I was responsible for leading and supervising teams of employees, 
                        which translates well into project management. I have experience in setting expectations, 
                        motivating teams, and ensuring that everyone works towards a common goal.</dd>
                <dt>Customer Focus:</dt>
                    <dd>I have a deep understanding of customer needs and providing excellent customer 
                        service. In project management, this customer-centric mindset can translate into a keen 
                        understanding of stakeholder requirements and effective communication to meet those needs. </dd>
                <dt>Time Management: </dt>
                    <dd>Managing a retail store involved juggling multiple tasks and priorities, which helped me develop 
                        strong time management skills. Project managers need to meet deadlines and keep projects on 
                        schedule, making this skill invaluable. </dd>
                <dt>Budgeting and Financial Management: </dt>
                    <dd>As a store manager I have experience with budgeting, inventory management, and financial 
                        reporting. These skills are transferable to project management, where managing project budgets 
                        and resources is essential.</dd>
                <dt>Problem-Solving: </dt>
                    <dd>I encountered various challenges daily, such as inventory issues, staffing 
                        problems, and customer complaints. I developed problem-solving skills that are critical in 
                        identifying and addressing issues that arise during project execution.</dd>
                <dt>Communication: </dt>
                    <dd>Effective communication is crucial in retail to convey expectations, policies, and changes to 
                        employees and customers. Project managers must also excel in communication to keep stakeholders 
                        informed, resolve conflicts, and ensure everyone understands project goals and progress.</dd>
                <dt>Adaptability: </dt>
                    <dd>I am accustomed to adapting to changing market conditions, customer preferences, 
                        and unexpected events. Project managers must likewise adapt to changes in project scope, 
                        timelines, and resources, making this skill highly transferable.</dd>
                <dt>Data Analysis: </dt>
                    <dd>I often used data to make informed decisions about inventory levels, sales 
                        trends, and customer behavior. This analytical mindset can be valuable in project management 
                        for evaluating project performance and making data-driven decisions.</dd>
                <dt>Conflict Resolution: </dt>
                    <dd>Handling conflicts among team members or with customers was a common task for me as a retail manger. 
                        Project managers frequently encounter conflicts within project teams and between stakeholders, 
                        making conflict resolution skills crucial.</dd>
                <dt>Customer Relationship Management: </dt>
                    <dd>Building and maintaining relationships with customers is a significant aspect of retail 
                        management. Project managers need to cultivate relationships with stakeholders, clients, and team 
                        members to ensure project success.</dd> 
                <dt>Attention to Detail: </dt>
                    <dd>I had to be meticulous in inventory management, visual merchandising, and compliance 
                        with operational standards. Attention to detail is equally important in project management to 
                        prevent errors and ensure project quality.</dd>
